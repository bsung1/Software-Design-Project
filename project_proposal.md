## **The Big Idea**

The goal of our project is to create a system that will generate potential meeting times based on people's inputted availability. To reach this goal, we will be exploring the topics of user interfaces, algorithms to find optimal time for meetings, and the input of data into a single data source/database. The minimum viable product we hope to provide is a system that takes single line inputs and generates non-recurring meeting times. The stretch goal would be to successfully be able to provide options for multiple days, the potential to schedule recurring meetings and would be able to connect with scheduling apps, such as Google Calendar.

## **Learning Goals**
Our team is hoping to strengthen our coding skills particularly in the topics listed above. We hope to further explore the different sources that we will be able to store inputted data and other information into. A core aspect of our project is the creation of an algorithm that will be able to generate potental solutions that fit the schedules of each team memmber. Thus, we are hoping to learn how to create an algorithm that can handle the complexity of a larger team and be able to solve for optimal meeting times. Part of our stretch goal would be to be able to have the system link to apps to optimize the efficiency and conveniency for its users which is another learning goal for the team. 

##

## **Implementation Plan**

This is a general rough plan for our approach to achieving our project goal. We hope to further refine this plan in the near future. 
#### 1. Creating an interface for the initial user to set a date and time frame for the meeting
#### 2. Creating an interface that asks each user "When are you available?"
#### 3. Creating an algorithm that offers potential meeting times based on the inputted data

##

## **Project Schedule**

#### Week 1-2: Creating a data storage source and interface for the initial user
#### Week 3-4: Creating an interface that allows following users to submit their availability
#### Week 5-6:Outputting accurate and optimal meeting time
#### Week 7-8: Final Testing & Implementation

##

## **Collaboration Plan**

We plan to divide the tasks and meet once a week to discuss and break down the work done over the time. We wish to keep the scope of the project small at first and start adding features once the interface and algorithm is complete. This way of organizing projects helps us focus on the highest risk tasks first, given our limited time frame. Given our plan, we will still keep all memebers of the team updated on the work we've done constantly and consult teammates about any problems or issues we may be having. 

##

## **Risks**

The highest risk is to create a user-friendly interface that combines functionality and design. Without the interface, the project would not be able to be completed. Additionally, collecting and storing data is a challenge for us. We want to be able to send link to all users inputting their information. Be able to store this data and integrate it with the formula is potentially a risk. Finally designing the formula that ensures that the optimal meeting time for all parties is the output can become our biggest risk if we are unable to implement it.
